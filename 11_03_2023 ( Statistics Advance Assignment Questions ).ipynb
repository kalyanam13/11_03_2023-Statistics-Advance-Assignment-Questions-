    "### Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "### Answer : The t-test and z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data, but they are applicable in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-test:\n",
    "### The t-test is typically used when the sample size is small (less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is particularly suitable for situations where you are comparing the means of two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example scenario for a t-test:\n",
    "### Suppose you want to test whether there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two different teaching methods. You collect a sample of 20 students who were taught using Method A and another sample of 20 students taught using Method B. You can use a t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-test:\n",
    "### The z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically n > 30) and the population standard deviation is known. It is commonly employed when testing hypotheses about the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example scenario for a z-test:\n",
    "### Imagine you have access to the test scores of 500 students in a population, and you want to test if the average score is significantly different from a hypothesized value. If you know the population standard deviation, you can use a z-test to assess whether the mean test score is significantly different from the hypothesized value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on factors such as the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known. Use a t-test for small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown, and use a z-test for larger sample sizes with a known population standard deviation."

    "In a one-tailed test, the null hypothesis specifies a particular direction (greater than or less than), and the alternative hypothesis focuses on that specific direction. The critical region is located on only one side of the distribution curve. One-tailed tests are often used when there is a specific expectation or prediction about the direction of the effect.\n",

The critical region is divided into two sides of the distribution curve. Two-tailed tests are used when you are interested in determining if there is a significant difference in either direction.\n",

The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by the significance level (α), which is set by the researcher.\n",

The significance level (α) is set at 0.05. If, based on the sample data, the researchers reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the drug is effective when, in reality, it has no effect, a Type I error has occurred.\n",

    "Type II Error:\n",
    "A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected when it is actually false. In other words, it's a false negative or a failure to detect a real effect or difference that exists. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by the symbol β.\n",

    "Example Scenario for Type II Error:\n",
    "Continuing with the drug example, let's say the drug does have a real effect, but the study fails to detect it. The null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected, and the researchers conclude that the drug is not effective when it actually is. In this case, a Type II error has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between Type I and Type II errors is often described by the concept of statistical power. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1 - β). Researchers aim to strike a balance between minimizing Type I and Type II errors based on the specific goals and risks associated with a study."
